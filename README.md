## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

![Data Architecture](docs/'Data_Architecture_Design')

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into SQL Sever Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
